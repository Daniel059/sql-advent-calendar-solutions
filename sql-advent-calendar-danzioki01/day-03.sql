-- Table: grinch_prank_ideas
--   prank_id: INTEGER
--   target_name: VARCHAR
--   prank_description: VARCHAR
--   evilness_score: INTEGER
--   created_at: TIMESTAMP
--

-- My Solution:

SELECT * 
FROM (
  SELECT target_name,
  prank_description,
  evilness_score,
ROW_NUMBER() OVER(
  PARTITION BY target_name 
  ORDER BY evilness_score DESC,created_at DESC
  ) AS Highest_Evil_Score 
FROM grinch_prank_ideas
  ) AS t
  WHERE t.Highest_Evil_Score = 1;
