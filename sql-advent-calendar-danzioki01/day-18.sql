-- Over the 12 days of her data challenge, Data Dawn tracked her daily quiz scores across different subjects. Can you find each subject's first and last recorded score to see how much she improved?
--

-- Table Schema:
-- Table: daily_quiz_scores
--   subject: VARCHAR
--   quiz_date: DATE
--   score: INTEGER
--

-- My Solution:

SELECT DISTINCT
    subject,
    FIRST_VALUE(score) OVER (PARTITION BY subject ORDER BY quiz_date ASC
                            ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING) AS first_score,
    LAST_VALUE(score) OVER (PARTITION BY subject ORDER BY quiz_date ASC
                           ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING) AS last_score
FROM daily_quiz_scores
ORDER BY subject;
